Selecting Columns: Extracting specific columns from the DataFrame.
Adding Columns: Creating new columns by performing computations or transformations on existing columns.
Dropping Columns: Removing unnecessary columns from the DataFrame.
Filter: Selecting rows from the DataFrame based on specified conditions.
Grouping and Aggregating: Grouping rows based on certain criteria and computing aggregate statistics, such as sum, average, count, etc., within each group.
Sorting: Arranging the rows of the DataFrame in a specified order based on column values.
Joining: Combining two DataFrames based on a common key or condition.

--> select the columns from the data frame in different ways.
--> add the new column/columns into a dataframe.
--> rename the columns on dataframe.
--> delete the columns whatever we want.
